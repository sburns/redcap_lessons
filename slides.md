# Why You're Here

- Your lab has lots of data in various spreadsheets
- Your PI told you to use REDCap
    - (They were probably bugged by VICTR)
- You have databases in REDCap but aren't sure why
- You went to the training but still don't **get** REDCap
    - Don't worry, it's not your fault


## It's hard to **understand** REDCap until you've done it a gazillion times

# Why I'm Here

- Lots of data
- Lots of mistakes
- Nobody told us how to do this

## I want to share what we've learned managing many large projects in REDCap

## Presenter Notes

- 4500 records spanning some 13600 columns across 40 redcap projects

# Goals For This Talk

- REDCap Terminology
- What REDCap **is** and **is not**
- Why you should move any data you care about to REDCap
- A brief taste on some of the *fancier* REDCap features

## Presenter Notes

- Knowing terminology let's you communicate with the REDCap team more
- The more you know what REDCap is capable of, the less you'll try and make it do things it can't
- Convince them that spreadsheets are bad

- Professional administration
- Professional backups
- High Availability

If REDCap goes down and takes your database with it, **you** won't get fired.
